"""
Seed compliance_tracking -- links every mine to the statutory_compliance_items
that apply to it, with a plausible status/due_date. Run this AFTER
load_seed_data.py (needs mines + statutory_compliance_items to already exist).

WHY THIS SCRIPT EXISTS
-----------------------
The Manager dashboard (frontend/pages/dashboard/manager.js) already queries
compliance_tracking joined with statutory_compliance_items -- that frontend
code was already built. But nothing ever inserted rows into
compliance_tracking, so every mine manager currently sees "No compliance
items loaded for this mine yet." This script closes that gap, AND gives the
risk-scoring job (risk_scoring_job.py) real per-mine signal for its
"Compliance Gap" flag type -- without it, that flag type would never fire.

WHAT IT DOES
------------
For every mine, for every statutory_compliance_item whose applicable_mine_type
matches that mine's type (OC/UG/Mixed -> OC/UG/Both), creates one
compliance_tracking row with:
  - a due_date derived from the item's frequency (Annual/Monthly/Weekly/
    Event-based/Ongoing) relative to today
  - a status (Completed/Pending/Overdue/Not Applicable) drawn from a
    per-mine "compliance health" score -- NOT uniform random. Each mine gets
    a deterministic health score in [0.35, 1.0] (seeded from its mine_id, so
    reruns are stable), and mines with a lower health score get a higher
    chance of Overdue items. This creates realistic variation across mines
    instead of every mine looking equally (non-)compliant, which is what the
    risk-scoring job needs to actually differentiate high-risk mines.

This is clearly synthetic/illustrative data for demo purposes -- there's no
real inspection history behind these statuses. Replace with real
inspector/manager-submitted completions over time (the Manager dashboard
already has no write-path for this yet -- that's a good next addition).
